# Binary Search

Binary Search works by dividing the search range by two each and every time it searches. This makes the algorithm run in $O(\log_2{n})$.

## BSTA (Binary Search The Answer)

The BSTA technique is a common technique in competitive programming problems where you divide all the possible answers for a correct one. This works only when you have a monotonic function that can represent the problem. For example, if given a number I can return a true or a false representing whether or not the number is a valid value, and we are asked to look for the maximal or minimal point, we can use binary search to search for that point. It would work by searching the upper half if the point we are looking at is true or false (depending on the problem) and search the lower half instead if the point we are looking at is the other boolean value.
