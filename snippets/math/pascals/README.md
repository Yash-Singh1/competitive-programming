# Pascal's Identity

Pascal's Identity is a mathematical relation between binomial coefficients. It can be used to calculate binomial coefficients from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, k)$ in $\mathcal{O}(nk)$ time.

## Explanation

The Pascal's Identity makes use of the relation from the Pascal's Triangle to calculate the binomial coefficients.

## Implementation

You can find an implementation at [pascals.cpp](./pascals.cpp).
